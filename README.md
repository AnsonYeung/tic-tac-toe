# Tic Tac Toe
A console version of tic tac toe written in Pascal

## Instructions
Please turn off the QuickEdit checkbox in the console properties if interacting with mouse is required.
If the selected flashes between two boxes (this happens on my machine), hold and release one of the arrow key can help to solve the issue.
The console input buffer can be cleaned automatically by the above method.
